# The-ISS-Locator
The International Space Station (ISS) is a joint project involving five space agencies: NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada) (Canada). Intergovernmental treaties and agreements govern the ownership and use of the space station.

Crew members conduct experiments in biology, physics, astronomy, and other subjects on the International Space Station, which functions as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory.

This project will show how to locate the International Space Station in realtime using Python and a rest API call and how to build a web app to share it with the world.
It will

-track the International Space Station using Rest APIs

-forecast using univariate data

-run a linear and polynomial regression in Python



### Methodology

- Got the names of astronauts currently on board

- Got the realtime location of the ISS

- Plotted the ISS on a world map

-Tracked and collected the ISS position for historic analysis

- Modeled ISS location data using both linear and polynomial regressions

- Created a real mobile Web Application on the cloud so you can use your phone to share the location of the ISS to all your friends

- Added a link to the official ISS live feed
