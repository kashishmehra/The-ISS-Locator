# The-ISS-Locator
The International Space Station (ISS) is a joint project involving five space agencies: NASA (USA), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada) (Canada). Intergovernmental treaties and agreements govern the ownership and use of the space station.

Crew members conduct experiments in biology, physics, astronomy, and other subjects on the International Space Station, which functions as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory.

This project will show how to locate the International Space Station in realtime using Python and a rest API call and how to build a web app to share it with the world.
It will

-track the International Space Station using Rest APIs

-forecast using univariate data

-run a linear and polynomial regression in Python


## Methodology
